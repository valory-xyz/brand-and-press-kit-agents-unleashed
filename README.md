This Press Kit summarizes our Brand Guidelines (inc. logos) and Information about Olas (formerly known as Autonolas, e.g. for Press Releases)

![styleguide](https://github.com/valory-xyz/press-kit/assets/106149667/23a48530-3152-443d-bd63-b9b3c5021828) ^to be updated with new image

## Brand Guidelines 

The "Olas" & "Autonolas" names, logos, brands, and other trademarks, are property of Olas DAO (aka Autonolas DAO^), protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret
and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws and may only be used per the Usage Terms (see below). These guidelines are intended to help people interacting with the Olas brand to understand how to use and display our trademarks and copyrighted work in their own assets and materials.

^Autonolas is also known as Olas, for short.

## Powered by Olas badge
If you are "building on Olas" – i.e. an active user of the Olas protocol, stack, autonomous services, agents or components built using Olas – we encourage you to use our “Powered by Olas” badge to recognize this. 

^ badges 
By using our Badges you agree to our Usage Terms (see below). Here are some examples:
Do: 
* Use the outlined badge version whenever possible. The filled badge version should be used when placed over a background image and when legibility is a concern.
* Use enough space around the badge—at least the size of the Olas logo that appears in the badge.
* Use at a minimum badge height of 32px.
Do not: 
* Modify the badge in any way.
* Translate the badge. In the future, we may provide translated versions for use directly.

## Language
Do:
* Link to [olas.network](https://olas.network) in articles, blog posts or other media mentions describing Olas' own work
* Publicly claim only relationships to the Olas DAO itself that are reflected in an on/off-chain vote, expressed as they are expressed therein ^to add link here.Request DAO contributors' written approval to publicly mention an existing relationship between you and them, e.g. a partnership, sponsorship, or grant program. 
* Use the specific language used in writing by the DAO in an on/off-chain vote and by DAO contributors regarding the relationship, e.g. 'we have received a grant from Valory, co-creators of Olas' or 'we are sponsoring an event with [name here], an Olas founding member'.
* Those building on Olas must use descriptive phrases that make it clear your product is developed on Olas technology (“powered by” is preferred, but “built on” can also be used). Avoid phrases that imply an official partnership with Olas (“built with”, “developed with”, “partnered with”).
Your company or product name should appear first, followed by Olas and the autonomous service or component name. Using 'Olas' in product or app names is prohibited because it confuses end users, e.g. 'OlasBots', etc.

Do not:
* Use the Olas logo (or part of our logo) in a way that implies the Olas DAO’s endorsement or sponsorship of a project, service, product or individual
* Misrepresent, embellish, or invent a relationship between the Olas DAO or any of its contributors and you (for example by implying a partnership where there exists only a grant, or referring to non-finalized agreements). The Olas DAO and its contributors likely have official partnerships and specific language about these partnerships, as well as non-partnership language guidance. If you are not an official partner, please don’t use “collaborated with,” “worked with,” or “partnered with,” in any form. (See above for accurate language.)

## Information about Olas & Press Releases 
When mentioning the Olas DAO or its members or contributors in your press materials, we kindly ask that you review the following information.

### Key information
#### Introduction
* Context: Olas is the network for generating & co-owning autonomous agent economies, based on cutting-edge decentralized autonomous agent technology. 
* Mission: Established in 2021, Olas' mission is to enable anyone to generate swarms of autonomous agents and grow them into entire economies, coordinated by the OLAS token.^ 
* Background: Olas consists of the composable [Olas Stack](https://olas.network/build) for developing on Olas and the [Olas Protocol](protocol.olas.network) incentivizing their creation and decentralized operation. Together this architecture works to grow code and capital in tandem via novel mechanisms including Bonding, Developer Rewards, Triple Lock, and Olas Staking's Proof of Active Agent (PoAA). Olas has already given rise to a growing ocean of services, including [Olas Predict](https://olas.network/services/prediction-agents), agents that are predicting the future and leading the charge of Olas agents [taking over Gnosis Chain and beyond](https://dune.com/adrian0x/autonolas-ecosystem-activity).^^^^ Since 'Olas' means 'waves' in Spanish, it is sometimes referred to as the 'ocean of services' 🌊.
* Crypto x AI: Olas is perfect for combining crypto and AI, since autonomous services built using Olas can run complex logic in a decentralized manner, interacting with on- and off-chain data autonomously and continuously. For novel use cases check out [olas.network](https://olas.network/).
